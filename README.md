# Developing seller persona for online-retail

Within this project seller personas for online-marketplace giant Olist will be developed. Based on prototypical attributes, the online-sellers are categorized into different peer groups. By knowing a sellerâ€™s category, their respective major characteristics can be inferred. The obtained insights help Olist to manage marketing measures more precisely and minimize coverage loss.




Independ from a specific business sector, it is important for a company to know its business partners. Extensive insights are necessary to derive strategic decisions and maintain long-term profitability. To categorize consumers or sellers, based on key behavioral patterns, so-called personas are used in Marketing. Within this approach, similarities and differences amongst a company's stakeholders are detected. On this basis, specific, homogeneous target groups and the corresponding companies can be identified. These can be used for further analysis and a data-driven decision-making. 


## Workflow in this project
To structurize the workflow of placing the sellers to specific classes, three Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are developed.
